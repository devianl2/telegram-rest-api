# Telegram REST API Server

A **Telegram REST API** server for user authentication and Telegram API operations. Built with **Fastify**, **TypeScript**, and **GramJS** (Telegram MTProto client). Exposes HTTP endpoints for sending login codes, resending codes, and signing in with a phone number and verification code.

## What is this project?

This project provides a REST API layer on top of the Telegram API. Instead of using the Telegram Bot API or running GramJS directly in your app, you can call this server over HTTP to:

- **Send a verification code** to a user's phone number (Telegram login flow)
- **Resend the verification code** using the same session
- **Sign in** with phone number, code hash, and the code received via SMS or Telegram

All endpoints use **GramJS** under the hood and follow the official [Telegram authentication](https://core.telegram.org/api/auth) flow. The server is designed to run in **Docker** and can be secured with an API key and `Accept: application/json` header checks.

## Tech stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js  
- **Framework:** Fastify  
- **Language:** TypeScript  
- **Telegram client:** GramJS (telegram)  
- **Deployment:** Docker Compose  

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository and add a `.env` file with `TELEGRAM_API_ID`, `TELEGRAM_API_HASH`, `APPLICATION_API_KEY`, and `PORT`.
2. Run with Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

3. Send requests with header `api-key: <APPLICATION_API_KEY>` and `Accept: application/json`.
